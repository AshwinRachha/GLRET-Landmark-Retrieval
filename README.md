# GLRET-Landmark-Retrieval

Image retrieval is a central problem in computer vision, relevant to many applications. The problem is usually posed as follows: given a query image, can you find similar images in a large database? 
This is especially important for query images containing landmarks, which accounts for a large portion of what people like to photograph.
In this competition, the developed models are expected to retrieve relevant database images to a given query image 
(i.e., the model should retrieve database images containing the same landmark as the query).
